1. Data Understanding and Preparation
1.1. Familiarize Yourself with the Dataset Structure

    Files & Columns
        mentalManip_detailed.csv: Contains each dialogue plus three annotators’ information, including whether the annotator marked it as manipulative (manipulative_1, manipulative_2, manipulative_3) or not, annotations about technique, vulnerability, etc.
        MentalManip_con vs. MentalManip_maj: Two versions of the dataset derived from the annotation agreement. One has only fully consistent (all three annotators agree) annotations, the other has majority-rule labeling.
    Labeling Strategy
        Decide which version of the dataset (consistent vs. majority) you want to use, or if you want to compare both. Some researchers prefer the “cleanest” set for an initial, high-precision model (MentalManip_con). Others prefer more data (MentalManip_maj).

1.2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

    Reading the CSV
        Use Python’s built-in csv module or another robust parser to avoid misalignment of columns (as you noted in your instructions).
        Check for any anomalies (e.g., missing values, encoding issues, multi-line text fields) that might break row consistency.

    Text Cleaning
        Remove or normalize special symbols (e.g., Unicode quotes, dashes).
        Potentially remove stop words, punctuation, or lower-case the text—though this can also be handled downstream by certain NLP models.

    Handling Duplicates & Missing Data
        Ensure there are no duplicate dialogue rows or suspicious annotation conflicts.
        Decide how to handle dialogues where an annotator’s fields are missing (e.g., if technique or confidence is not provided). You might drop or impute, depending on the volume of missingness.

1.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Label Distribution
        Look at the ratio of manipulative vs. non-manipulative examples in each version (MentalManip_con vs. MentalManip_maj). Confirm these match the provided statistics.
        Investigate the interplay between annotator confidence and manipulative classification.

    Technique Frequency and Co-occurrence
        You already have a frequency distribution of techniques (e.g., “Persuasion or Seduction,” “Shaming or Belittlement,” etc.).
        Conduct co-occurrence analysis: Are certain techniques frequently appearing together (e.g., “Accusation” + “Shaming or Belittlement”)?
        This can inform you if multi-label classification (detecting more than one manipulative technique at once) could be relevant.

    Length & Linguistic Features
        Check dialogue length (number of tokens, sentences). Are manipulative dialogues generally longer or shorter than non-manipulative ones?
        Check for unique words or patterns (e.g., sentiment distribution, presence of negative/positive words).

1.4. Data Label Finalization

    Binary Classification vs. Multi-label
        Binary: You may start with simply classifying whether a dialogue is manipulative or not.
        Multi-label: Later, incorporate which manipulation technique(s) are present.

    Selecting Which Dataset Version
        Possibly train one model using the “clean” subset (MentalManip_con) and another using the larger, majority-based set (MentalManip_maj). Compare performance to see which is more robust.

2. Modeling and Classification
2.1. Feature Engineering Options

    Classical NLP Approaches (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words)
        Simple and fast to implement.
        Often a good baseline before moving to deeper embeddings.
        Limited ability to capture context, but can still reveal strong lexical cues.

    Neural Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
        Word-level embeddings that capture semantic similarity.
        Still require an additional layer (e.g., an LSTM, CNN, or even logistic regression) to perform classification on dialogue-level features.

    Transformer-based Embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT)
        Contextual embeddings that often yield state-of-the-art results for text classification.
        Potentially fine-tune a pretrained model (e.g., a Dutch BERT variant if you want to generalize to Dutch dialogues in the future, or an English model for the Cornell-based portion).
        Good at capturing deeper linguistic cues and manipulative language patterns.

2.2. Modeling Strategy

    Baseline Models
        Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes on TF-IDF vectors.
        Advantage: Quick training, interpretable coefficients, rapid iteration.
        Disadvantage: May not capture complex manipulative language well.

    Deep Learning Models
        LSTM or BiLSTM with pretrained embeddings.
        Transformer-based finetuning (BERT-like architectures).
        Advantage: Likely higher accuracy on nuanced manipulative language.
        Disadvantage: More resource-intensive, require careful hyperparameter tuning and GPU/TPU resources.

    Multi-task or Multi-label Approaches
        If you want to classify both “manipulative or not” and which manipulation technique, you can use multi-label classification.
        Could also explore hierarchical classification: Step 1 (manipulative vs. not), Step 2 (technique category).

2.3. Training & Evaluation Setup

    Data Splits
        Split your dataset into train/validation/test sets. If data is limited, consider cross-validation for robust performance estimates.

    Evaluation Metrics
        Precision, Recall, F1-score: Particularly relevant for manipulative detection, where false negatives can be more concerning than false positives (missing a manipulative case).
        Confusion Matrix: Inspect the false positives vs. false negatives.
        AUC-ROC: If you want a single measure that accounts for class imbalance.
        Macro-average F1: If classes are unbalanced, macro-F1 ensures you weigh the minority class fairly.

    Hyperparameter Tuning
        If using deep learning, tune learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
        If using classical ML, do grid search or random search for the best regularization strength, C parameter, etc.

2.4. Handling Class Imbalance

    The dataset shows more manipulative than non-manipulative examples (2.24:1 or 2.38:1 ratio).
    Potential Techniques:
        Up-sample the minority class (non-manipulative) or down-sample the majority class (manipulative).
        Use class weights in your loss function to penalize mistakes on the minority class more heavily.
        F1-score or macro-F1 is often a better metric than accuracy in such cases.

3. Model Interpretation and Validation Against Your Goal
3.1. Interpretability

    Explainable AI Tools: LIME, SHAP, or integrated gradients can highlight which parts of the text are pushing the model to label a dialogue as manipulative.
    Qualitative Analysis: Manually check model predictions on a subset of dialogues to see if the model’s reasoning aligns with the psychological theories you care about (Dark Triad, persuasion, etc.).

3.2. Does the Model Reflect “Real” Manipulation?

    Compare model predictions to known manipulative vs. non-manipulative dialogues from outside your training set.
    Check alignment with psychologist or expert annotations: see if the model is capturing the same signals or missing certain manipulative techniques.

3.3. Feasibility for the Website Tool

    If your ultimate goal is to let users upload chat logs:
        Evaluate the model on real-world chat data (if available) or data that’s closer to user–AI interactions, not just movie transcripts.
        You might need to do domain adaptation if there’s a domain mismatch (movie language vs. real chat language).

4. Integration with the Larger Research and Safety Goals
4.1. Linking to the “Dark Triad” or Other Psychological Constructs

    Supplementary Features
        If the dataset captures “technique” or “victim” flags, you can correlate them with manipulative behaviors typically associated with Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism).
        You might design a sub-experiment: see if dialogues that show “Accusation” or “Shaming” also have higher alignment with Machiavellian traits.

    Future Work
        Consider gathering or labeling new data specifically for “Dark Triad manipulative style.”
        Use the existing framework (self-report questionnaires + text-based evidence) for LLM-based chat logs.

4.2. Building the Testing Framework

    Open-Source Codebase
        Provide scripts for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation to facilitate quick adaptation to new LLM chat logs.
        Maintain versioning so that when new models or new annotation data come in, it’s straightforward to integrate.

    Website Deployment Strategy
        Once the classifier is sufficiently accurate, create an API endpoint where the user’s chat log is sent.
        The model returns a probability score of manipulative tendencies and highlights suspicious segments.
        Provide disclaimers about potential false positives/negatives and invite user feedback to improve the model.

    Ongoing Monitoring
        Log real-world usage (anonymized) to see if the model is systematically misclassifying certain categories.
        Conduct periodic re-training or fine-tuning to adapt to new chatbot language patterns.
